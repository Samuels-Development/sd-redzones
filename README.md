# sd-redzones

A simple redzone script, that gives players weapons (Config.LoadoutItems), rewards them for killing other players within the marked zone and then teleports the dead/injured outside of the zone and revives them. I wrote this in 30-40 minutes, I'm happy to continue to improve upon it if anybody actually wants it, please create PR requests if you have stuff you'd like to improve and create an issue case you encounter a bug that needs addressing.
